# SpeedRun
Project made for Data Structures and Algorithms subject at University

Consists in a program that applies different solutions to the proposed problem "SpeedRun". Our main goal was to develop more efficient algorithms than the one already given, and to compare their complexities.

Details about the proposed problem can be found in this [guide.](https://github.com/Barb02/AED_SpeedRun/blob/main/guiaoSpeedRun)
Report also avaible, [here.](https://github.com/Barb02/AED_SpeedRun/blob/main/SpeedRun.pdf)
